We will use both classification and regression techniques to produce three models that predict popularity, longevity, and 3-year sales volume of new Swire Coca-Cola B2B customers using historical customer and sales data provided by Swire Coca-Cola, as well as census and customer review data externally sourced by the project team. The output of the three models will be probability of customer popularity (classified as 4.0 or higher; customer longevity classfied into three groups, 1, 2, and 3+ years; and total 3-year sales volume.   \n",
